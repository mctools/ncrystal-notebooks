    "Apart from being used by itself, the original reason for developing NCrystal was indeed to serve as a backend engine for existing Monte Carlo codes, providing a consistent high-fidelity neutron scattering physics to those. One advantage here is of course that it allows both developers and users across all of the supported codes to collaborate on the neutron scattering models. In this notebook, we will focus on three such applications that are all well-supported, widely used, and open-source: OpenMC, McStas, and Geant4."

    "2. After creation with `mat=openmc.Material.from_ncrystal(..)`, you can not use the usual OpenMC API to modify the material density, temperature, or composition. So be sure to reflect the final desired material inside the NCrystal cfg-string.\n",
    "3. The OpenMC binaries must have been built with NCrystal support, or your job will fail once you launch the simulation (you can check for this by running the command `openmc -v`). Specifically (as documented on https://docs.openmc.org/en/stable/usersguide/install.html) you must supply the CMake flag\n",
    "`cmake -DOPENMC_USE_NCRYSTAL=on ..` (and make sure NCrystal is available already).\n",
