    "## Single crystal materials\n",
    "NCrystal supports both isotropic and anisotropic materials. Currently, the only anisotropic models shipped with NCrystal are mosaic single crystals. One is a more generally useful model of Gaussian mosaicity, and the other one is a dedicated one needed to support the special rotated distribution found in pyrolytic graphite (PG). The PG model is automatically enabled when the relevant data file (`C_sg194_pyrolytic_graphite.ncmat`) is used as a single crystal (if not used as a single crystal, it can be used as standard graphite).\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, single crystal models are enabled by supplying the material with a mosaic spread (FWHM of the Gaussian mosaicity), and an orientation. The orientation must be specified by providing the coordinates of two vectors in both the crystal space (i.e. the unit cell coordinate system), and the \"lab\" space (i.e. where the neutron direction is defined). Specifically, we always need the `dir1`, `dir2`, and `mos` to be set, and there are a few other parameters that one might use to fine-tune the models. As always, see the documentation at https://github.com/mctools/ncrystal/wiki/CfgRefDoc .\n",
    "\n",
    "NCrystal does not provide a simple utility to quickly plot cross sections for anisotropic materials, since the cross sections in general depend on both neutron energy and direction. However, for the case of single crystals used as monochromators, one will often generate *rocking curves*, showing a neutron cross section as a function of incidence angle. If you execute the next code cell below, you will be able to study various monochromator profiles (and then click to the left of the code cell to collapse it and hide the actual code, unless you have a specific interest).\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, the assumption that a monochromator can always be described by a simplistic gaussian is not always very good - especially for neutrons at shorter wavelengths or in monochromators with higher mosaic spreads. Although it should in fairness be noted, that a real monochromator often is accompanied by some sort of angular selection (e.g. a collimator), which makes the plots below appear worse than they are. Still, single crystals can indeed be said to provide rather complicated and interesting cross sections!!"

You can either use it for advanced studies with the McStas Union sub-system through the NCrystal_process component, or it can be used via the dedicated (and simpler+less feature-rich) NCrystal_sample.comp. In any case, the McStas instrument file compilation will need to build against NCrystal, and it uses the ncrystal-config command to figure out the correct settings for doing so. Thus, you can always invoke `ncrystal-config -s` to find out if you have the right NCrystal installation available and active. It is currently the case (May, 2023) that most McStas users will find that NCrystal has already been installed as part of their McStas installation, albeit there might be a need to activate the NCrystal installation by invoking (the script might eventually be renamed ncrystal-setup.sh or similar):\n",
