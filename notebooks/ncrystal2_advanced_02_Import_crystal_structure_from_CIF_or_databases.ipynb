Well, first of all you could have looked at the structure in the resulting material and tried to read about the structure in the references (or in online search results), and perhaps you would have been satisfied. Barring an experimental campaign at a powder diffractometer, there is one other approach which fortunately is possible for most materials: Find not just 1, but many, entries for the material in online databases, and see how they compare after loading. Perhaps load each of them like above, and finally use `NCrystal.plot.plot_xsects` to check that the Bragg edges all line up. But there is one other quick-and-dirty way, which is to ask NCrystal to compare the crystal structure in a given NCMAT file, with any online database entries references in the comments of that NCMAT file. For instance, we saw above that `\"stdlib::Bi_sg166.ncmat\"` contained a total of 5 such mentions of COD entries, and we can easily check them like this:"

    "* You can trust the results if using McStas (incl. McStasScript) because NCrystal provides the whole physics in terms of macroscopic cross sections.\n",
    "* You can **NOT** use such materials in OpenMC or Geant4: they will likely fail already during initialisation when asked to prepare data with the element \"Og\" (Z=118).\n",

    "## Online databases\n",
    "In addition to the Crystallography Open Database (COD) at https://www.crystallography.net/cod/, NCrystal currently has built-in support for one other database, namely the Materials Project at https://materialsproject.org/ which you can reference like \"mpid::23231\" (for the entry  https://www.materialsproject.org/materials/mp-23231). Unlike the very straight-forward usage of COD, there are a few things to be aware off when accessing the Materials Project:\n",
    "* CIF data is generated on-the-fly on the Materials Project, so it might come in a variety of \"settings\" (e.g. low-precision vs. high-precision numbers, or primitive versus conventional cell). So to make sure you get a CIF file which is most appropriate for NCrystal, **do not download the CIF data from the website manually**. Instead, use the website to find the material ID (say, `23231`), and the use the string `mpid::23231` in place of a path to the CIF file in your NCrystal code.\n",
    "* Access requires an API key. It is simple to get, just sign in to the materialsproject.org site (using e.g. your GitHub, google or facebook acount), and access your dashboard by clicking the small logo in the upper right corner. On the dashboard page you can see you API key, which is a (random looking) string of 32 characters. If you put that string into the environment variable named `MATERIALSPROJECT_USER_API_KEY`, then the access should work just as it does for COD. You can do that by putting an `export` statement in your `.bashrc`, or in whatever way is appropriate for your system. If all else fail, you can do it directly in Python:"
