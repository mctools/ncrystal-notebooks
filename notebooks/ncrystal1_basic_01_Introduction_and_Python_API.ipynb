    "Multiphase materials can be composed in cfg-strings from existing materials the following `\"phases<...>\"` cfg-string syntax, listing the desired phases and their **volume** (not mass) fraction. This is as easy as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "   \"phases<0.1*PbS_sg225_LeadSulfide.ncmat&0.9*Epoxy_Araldite506_C18H20O3.ncmat>\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Cfg-parameters can be applied as always, affecting either a single phase or all phases depending on placement. For instance, in the following (somewhat silly) material the temperature of 300K applies to all phases, while the d-spacing cutoff only affects the aluminium:\n",
    "```\n",
    "   \"phases<0.25*Al_sg225.ncmat;dcutoff=0.4&0.75*Be_sg194.ncmat>;temp=300K\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that whitespace is allowed, if you feel it provides a more readable string Also note that the `\"phases<>\"` syntax has been chosen specifically to support the use-case that one can always override parameters in cfg-strings by appending a simple string to them. For instance appending the string `\";temp=400K\"` to any cfg-string will override the temperature value - whether or not the cfg-string uses the `\"phases<...>\"` syntax or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "For convenience it is also possible to define multiple phases directly inside NCMAT data. Additionally, NCrystal also has framework-level support for SANS physics, which can be thought of as diffraction due to the geometric layouts of the individual phases. We shall see an example in another notebook."

    "  * This includes the [Data-library](https://github.com/mctools/ncrystal/wiki/Data-library) and [CfgRefDoc](https://github.com/mctools/ncrystal/wiki/CfgRecDoc) pages which most users might need.\n",
    "  * For advanced users, the offical [NCMAT format specification](https://github.com/mctools/ncrystal/wiki/NCMAT-format) is there as well, along with instructions for usage or development of optional [plugins](https://github.com/mctools/ncrystal/wiki/Plugins).\n",
    "  * Be sure to check out the various release Announcement pages you find in the sidebar, since a lot of information was described there but still didn't make it anywhere else.\n",
    "* The Python API contains doc-strings everywhere, accessible though the `help` function. Please use it!\n",
    "* All command-line tools support a `--help` flag, which will result in usage instructions being printed out.\n",
    "* For C++ developers: Lots and lots of thorough comments are left everywhere in the code.\n",

    "  * **Please sign up to \"watch\" the discussions if you are an NCrystal user that want to contribute by helping other users**\n",
    "* **Reporting bugs or feature requests**\n",
    "  * Please (please!) do so using the tracker at https://github.com/mctools/ncrystal/issues\n",
    "  * Don't worry if you don't get the meta-data of the request correct, we can fix it up later.\n",
    "  * Do try to include as many details as possible about your issue, so we don't have to drag them out of you.\n",
    "* **Sending emails to NCrystal developers**\n",
    "  * Of course you can do so, but please (please!) consider first if you could not use one of the other manner of contacts above.\n",
    "  * Emails can be very distracting, since in practice they must be dealt with either \"immediately\" or \"never\".\n",
    "  * We will never be upset at getting emails, but you might get a short reply asking you to post your problem in one of the GitHub channels instead.\n"
