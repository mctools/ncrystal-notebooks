    "This notebook describes how one can use the NCMATComposer helper class from the NCrystal Python modules to create [[NCMAT data|NCMAT-format.md]] representing a given material to be used with NCrystal. This can either be done by directly inputting all desired material data directly, or by (fully or partially) using data from existing sources: NCMAT data, NCrystal.Info objects, NCrystal cfg-strings, CIF files, Quantum Espresso output, and many other files through [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/). Rather than being a complete API reference, the present page will simply present a range of examples."

    "It is of course also possible in NCrystal to add externally available scattering kernels to materials. However, there are several complications one needs to be aware of:\n",

    "1. Such pre-calculated kernels will only be valid for a specific temperature, and attempting to modify the temperature to a different value (i.e. `\"mymat.ncmat;temp=200K\"`) will result in an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Such pre-calculated kernels are large. For that reason, we currently (v3.6) only ship two materials in our standard data library, namely room temperature water and heavy water. We do that for the simple reason, that our VDOS expansion code currently only supports solids, and not liquids. For other temperatures, one can find and download data files from the `validated` subfolder at: https://github.com/mctools/ncrystal-extra/tree/master/data . In the same repository, one can also find other materials converted from the ENDF v8 release, however one should most likely be very careful when using these, since they were not manually validated and at the very least lacks proper densities and crystal structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It is currently not possible for NCrystal to estimate atomic displacements from pre-calculated kernels, so materials with these will only provide inelastic scattering. Again, this is mostly suitable for liquids.\n",

    "### Getting atomic displacement from VDOS\n",
    "\n",
    "When a phonon VDOS curve is available, it is possible to estimate the mean-squared atomic displacements at a given temperature by performing a numerical integral over the DOS curve multiplied by a function $f(E)=\\frac{1}{E\\tanh(E/2kT)}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, $E\\tanh(E/2kT)$ tends to 0 like $E^2$, so in order for the integral to be well-formed, it is important that the DOS also tends to 0 like at least $E^2$ near $E=0$. This assumption is always required for phonon curves in NCrystal, and we will go into more details about that in another notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important point is: A phonon VDOS curve is sufficient to provide not only inelastic scattering physics in solids, but also the Debye-Waller factors needed to model elastic physics. Specifically NCrystal use these Debye-waller factors to model both incoherent-elastic components, as well as coherent-elastic components (incl. Bragg diffraction in case of a crystalline material)."
